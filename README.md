# Common Spatial Pattern

## Introduction
One significant step in brain-computer interface (BCI) signal processing is feature extraction, in motor-imagery (MI) paradigm a commonly used method is called common-spatial pattern (CSP). This is my implementation of CSP algorithm on BCI dataset IV 2a. The algorithm implemented in this code is based on [1], details of the dataset can be seen on [2]
